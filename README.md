# Semantic-role-labeling-with-SNN

Repository for my Bachelor thesis, "Semantic role labeling with spiking neural networks using surrogate gradient learning."
This includes the code, the pdf file, and all data and results that I used to write the thesis.

If you download the whole repository and open the code, it will work right out of the box.
If you remove the results files, the models will be trained again. If you remove the data files as well, the data will be newly generated from the input .txt file.
